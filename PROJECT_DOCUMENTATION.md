```typescript
function calculateAssessmentScore(responses: Response[]): AssessmentResult {
  let correctAnswers = 0;
  let totalQuestions = responses.length;
  
  responses.forEach(response => {
    if (response.selectedAnswer === response.correctAnswer) {
      correctAnswers++;
    }
  });
  
  const percentage = (correctAnswers / totalQuestions) * 100;
  const grade = calculateGrade(percentage);
  
  return {
    score: correctAnswers,
    total: totalQuestions,
    percentage: Math.round(percentage * 100) / 100,
    grade: grade,
    analysis: performAnalysis(responses)
  };
}
```

**Question Randomization Algorithm:**
```typescript
function randomizeQuestions(questionPool: Question[], count: number): Question[] {
  const shuffled = [...questionPool].sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
  return shuffled.slice(0, count);
}

function randomizeOptions(question: Question): Question {
  const options = [...question.options];
  const correctAnswer = question.correctAnswer;
  
  // Shuffle options while maintaining correct answer reference
  const shuffledOptions = options.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
  const newCorrectIndex = shuffledOptions.indexOf(correctAnswer);
  
  return {
    ...question,
    options: shuffledOptions,
    correctAnswer: shuffledOptions[newCorrectIndex]
  };
}
```

**Performance Trend Analysis:**
```typescript
function analyzeTrends(testResults: TestResult[]): TrendAnalysis {
  const sortedResults = testResults.sort((a, b) => 
    new Date(a.completedAt).getTime() - new Date(b.completedAt).getTime()
  );
  
  const scores = sortedResults.map(result => result.percentage);

### 6.7 Electronic Data Communication Design

**API Communication Protocol:**

**REST API Endpoints:**
```
Authentication:
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/logout
GET  /auth/profile

Assessments:
GET  /assessments/available
POST /assessments/start
POST /assessments/submit
GET  /assessments/results/:id

Progress:
GET  /progress/overview
GET  /progress/detailed
POST /progress/update

AI Tutor:
POST /ai/chat
GET  /ai/recommendations
```

**Real-time Communication (Supabase Realtime):**
```typescript
// Subscribe to real-time updates
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('student-progress')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'test_results'
    },
    (payload) => {
      updateProgressInRealTime(payload.new);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

**Data Synchronization Strategy:**
```typescript
class DataSyncService {
  async syncStudentData(studentId: string): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Fetch remote data
      const remoteData = await this.fetchRemoteData(studentId);
      
      // Compare with local data
      const localData = await this.getLocalData(studentId);
      
      // Resolve conflicts (last-write-wins)
      const mergedData = this.mergeData(localData, remoteData);
      
      // Update local storage
      await this.updateLocalData(mergedData);
      
      // Upload pending changes
      await this.uploadPendingChanges(studentId);
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Sync failed:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.8 System Maintenance

**Automated Maintenance Tasks:**

**1. Database Maintenance:**
```sql
-- Automated cleanup of expired sessions
DELETE FROM user_sessions 
WHERE expires_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Archive old test results
INSERT INTO test_results_archive 
SELECT * FROM test_results 
WHERE completed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
```

**2. Performance Monitoring:**
```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  async monitorSystemHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus> {
    const metrics = await Promise.all([
      this.checkDatabaseConnection(),
      this.checkAPIResponseTimes(),
      this.checkMemoryUsage(),
      this.checkActiveUsers()
    ]);
    
    return {
      status: this.determineOverallStatus(metrics),
      metrics: metrics,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(metrics)
    };
  }
}
```

**3. Data Backup Strategy:**
```typescript
class BackupService {
  async performDailyBackup(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Backup user data
      await this.backupTable('students');
      await this.backupTable('test_results');
      await this.backupTable('progress_tracking');
      
      // Backup to multiple locations
      await this.uploadToCloudStorage();
      await this.createLocalSnapshot();
      
      // Verify backup integrity
      await this.verifyBackupIntegrity();
      
    } catch (error) {
      await this.alertAdministrators(error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
